# X-Team 56 Rules

These rules establish how our team will assign tasks,
track progress on each task, and communicate with each other 
when a member is unable to complete a task that has been assigned to that member.

This document helps individual members understand the team's expectations,
and will hopefully lead to productive team work with fewer conflicts
and missed deadlines.

## How we will assign (and reassign) tasks
The first step will be to break down big projects or tasks into smaller, more manageable sub-tasks. Once we have these sub-tasks, we will designate tasks to those who are best equipped to handle them. By doing this, we will have testable and efficiently designed code. 

## How will we will track progress (and follow-up) on completion of tasks
We have a groupchat where we routinely check in and ask for help. During projects, we meet as a group twice a week to make sure everybody is on the same page with our progrramming plan. Anyone who is confused about their current or future tasks will be helped there.

## How will will communicate difficulties with a task assigned to us
As stated above, as soon as we run into problems, we will communicate them to the team, so we have as much time as possible to address them, whether it be through our groupchat or in our face to face meetings. Larger technical or design problems will be addressed in our face to face meetings.

## How we will back up each other to ensure that deadlines are not missed
 Communication, and willingness to respond quickly is very important. The groupchat will be used for immediate issues such as syntax problems or other minor difficulties. A larger / more urgent issue may call for a meeting to resolve. With respect to our deadlines, we will all keep each other accountable in our groupchat with frequent reminders from everybody.

## Add any other rules that your team establishes to help each other work effectively together
-Make sure work is split up evenly, and that nobody is left behind or confused about what the group is trying to accomplish. -If you have to miss a team meeting make sure to let everybody know before hand and make sure anything neccesary to share has been shared. 
-In general, treat all members of the team with respect and courtesy, especially if you disagree with an idea!
